Elm interface to maps API.

> In future we will need to have rewrited full maps library in pure Elm. I'm  not so ambitious for that a huge project. 
> This project is temporary solutions which use most popular javascript library [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/ http://leafletjs.com/ ).
> Original API for [Google maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started/), [SMapy](https://api.mapy.cz) and [Yandex](https://tech.yandex.ru/maps/) will be implemented too.

The Map(s) interface for "cartographic" maps are named Karta (from *cartographic*, greek **χάρτης**, as germanian **die Karte** or russian **карта**).
Name "Map" is conflicts with name for objects structure and mapping function "map". In functional programming widely used.
